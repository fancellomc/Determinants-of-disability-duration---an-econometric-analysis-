# Study on the determinants of disability duration

## Objective of the project: 
As the duration of disability seems to be the most explanatory factor of the employment situation of individuals with disabilities, we will study the determinants of the duration of disability. More specifically, we study the influence of the economic and social conditions of individuals, with a focus on working conditions, on the duration of disability. We will first present the evaluation methods used, our results as well as possible improvements to these estimates.
